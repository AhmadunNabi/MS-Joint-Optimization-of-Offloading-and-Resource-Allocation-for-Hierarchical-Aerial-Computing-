# MS-Thesis-User-association-between-ground-user-GUs-and-UAVs-and-GUs-offloading-decision
This repository contains a Matching Game Theory-based approach for user association between ground users (GUs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), along with the binary offloading decision of GUs. It is part of my master's thesis, "Joint Optimization of Offloading and Resource Allocation for Hierarchical Aerial Computing Systems for IoT."

**The extended version of this work is currently under the trird-round revision in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing**. After publication, we will publicly share the pseudocode. For now, I am sharing the code for the Matching Game-based user association and the GUs' offloading decision.

* We have considered GUs which generates tasks randomly and make offloading decision as well as asociate with most preferred UAV using Matching game based algorithm
* Afther this UAV make partial offloading decision to HAP, then UAV and HAP allocate their computation resource using enhanced soft actor critic algorithm
